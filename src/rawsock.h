/**
 * Does an "open" on the network adapter. What actually happens depends upon
 * the operating system and drivers that we are using, but usually this just
 * calls "pcap_open()"
 * @param adapter_name
 *      The name of the adapter, like "eth0" or "dna1".
 * @param is_pfring
 *      Whether we should attempt to use the PF_RING driver (Linux-only)
 * @param is_sendq
 *      Whether we should attempt to use a ring-buffer for sending packets.
 *      Currently Windows-only, but it'll be enabled for Linux soon. Big
 *      performance gains for Windows, but insignificant performance 
 *      difference for Linux.
 * @param is_packet_trace
 *      Whether then Nmap --packet-trace option was set on the command-line
 * @param is_offline
 *      Whether the --offline parameter was set on the command-line. If so,
 *      then no network adapter will actually be opened.
 * @return
 *      a fully instantiated network adapter
